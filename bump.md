## Aim and Scope
The publishing system in computer science mainly relies on conferences, which has three major problems:

1. The number of papers that can be presented in a conference is limited, and that did not scale as fast as the community grew, leading to many good papers being"rejected" even though they propose interesting ideas and solid science.
2. Publishing in conference is expensive and cannot be afforded by researchers in many countries, essentially excluding them from the community as they lack the funds to register to and travel at international conferences.
3. High quality journals do exist but are less regarded than conferences, leading to chronic lack of reviewers and long reviewing process. Furthermore, few journals are open access, and those that are charge expensive article processing fess, therefore excluding researchers with limited funds, just like conferences.

The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) aims to address these problems by offering a high-quality journal for computer science systems research with guaranteed short review process and a diamond open access model; that is, free to read, free to publish. JSys proposes a forward-looking model of reviewing where the reviewers and the researchers work together to make each paper stronger, while preserving double-blind anonymity to limit bias; after acceptance, papers are published alongside a summary of the reviews and the name of their reviewers. This provides more transparency in the review process as well as fair credit for the work of reviewers.

# Policies

## Submission Policies

The editors reserve the right to determine the suitability of submissions. For additional information, please contact the editors.

JSys does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.

Submissions to JSys are processed via double-blind reviewing process. The submissions
must be made anonymous by the authors.

JSys does not use a plagiarism checking system. 

## Removal

Once published, a journal article cannot generally be revised or removed. We feel it is important to provide perpetual access to materials published whenever possible and appropriate. However, we will remove publications under special circumstances, including in the case of submission errors, rights violations, or inappropriate content. Please be aware, however, that even after the removal of a work, a citation to the work will remain in our system, along with a URL.

If you would like your work removed from eScholarship, please contact the editors.

## Revising Work

Once manuscripts are published, we are generally unable to revise them. If a significant error or omission is discovered, contact the editors.

## Rights and Permissions

Journal of Systems Research does not require copyright transfer, only permission to publish and archive the article. Copyright holders retain copyright ownership, granting a nonexclusive license to the journal and eScholarship to publish the article, meaning that the author may also publish it elsewhere. Before submitting an article to the journal, please be sure that all necessary permissions have been cleared in any third party material. All articles published in the journal are subject to the journalâ€™s author agreement, which is available in the first step of the submission process or by contacting us to request a copy.

## Open Access statement

This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. Journal of Systems Research uses a CC BY-NC license.

## Long-term preservation policy

All materials submitted to eScholarship are automatically deposited in CDL's Merritt Preservation Repository for long-term preservation.

# Submission Guidelines

Please submit your paper as a PDF on the OpenReview portal. Look at the call for papers for more details. 

Important Deadlines
Submission Deadlines: Mar 1st, May 1st, Aug 1st, Nov 1st 

A paper submitted by Mar 1st will receive initial reviews by April 15th. For papers receiving a Revise decision, the authors can revise and submit anytime in the next three months. If they submit by the 15th of the month (for example, by June 15), they will receive a final decision in one month (July 15). 

# Call for Papers: Per Area

In addition, and given the breadth of the scientific areas of JSys, each area defines the set of topics that it covers in the following Calls for Papers per Area:

Streaming Systems
Distributed Consensus
Networking
Wireless Embedded Systems
Serverless Systems
Decentralized Systems
